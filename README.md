**WIP!!! Not useful right now!**

Raspberry Pi PWM fan control for Venus OS

Based on [RpiTemperature](https://github.com/TimD1981/RpiTemperature).

Add the CPU temperature to Victron Venus OS (if running on Raspberry PI) and adds a PWM control .

It is possible to set a custom name for the raspberry pi temperature. It is also possible to define the type of temperature sensor (battery, freezer, other). 
I would recommend to use type other.

Setup:

- RpiFanControl requires that SetupHelper is installed first.

The easiest way to install RpiFanControl is to do a "blind install" of SetupHelper and then add the RpiFanControl package
via the PackageManager menus.

Refer to SetupHelper here:
